            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>
                Spirit island, located in the heart of Maligne Lake, Jasper was a spiritual place of 
                healing for the rocky mountain tribe for over 2000 years before they were displaced in the 1900s. 
                They believed that each mountain with a face in the hall of the gods (the mountains in front of spirit island) 
                contains the essence of each god of each religion as well as all notable rocky mountain tribesmen.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2020, there was a forest fire in a nearby forest region of Lake Maligne. Because of that forest fire, 
                the few remaining tribe members from that same rocky mountain tribe approached the Canadian government to 
                get access to Spirit Island away since they believe that the forest fire was a punishment by their gods for being 
                away from their spiritual home for so long. Now, the rocky mountain tribe works with the Canadian government to 
                perform their spiritual healing once a year.
